# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Day Break

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for "Day Break," a simple
Flutter application designed to provide users with a timely weather
announcement for their location. The app's core function is to fetch the
user's location, retrieve the daily weather forecast, and announce it at a
user-specified time.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

* **Goal:** To create a minimalist, "set and forget" weather app that
  proactively informs users about their day's weather via notifications.
* **Objectives:**
  * Develop a simple and intuitive user interface for setup and configuration.
  * Implement reliable location detection.
  * Provide weather information exclusively through a daily notification.
  * Allow users to configure the time of the daily weather announcement.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary target audience is individuals who want a quick and effortless way
to know the day's weather forecast without needing to open a complex weather
application. This includes busy professionals, students, and anyone who
appreciates a simple, automated daily routine.

## 4. Features and Requirements

### 4.1. Core Features

#### 4.1.1. Location Detection

* **Requirement:** The app must be able to obtain the user's current 
geographical location (latitude and longitude).
* **User Story:** As a user, I want the app to automatically detect my location 
so I can receive relevant weather forecasts.
* **Details:**
  * The app will request location permissions upon first launch.
  * It should handle cases where location services are denied or unavailable 
  gracefully. If the user denies location access, the app should prompt them to 
  enter their location manually.
  * Location should be fetched periodically or on-demand to ensure accuracy 
  without excessive battery drain.

#### 4.1.2. Scheduled Weather Announcement

* **Requirement:** The app must deliver a weather forecast at a time specified 
by the user.
* **User Story:** As a user, I want to set a specific time (e.g., 7:00 AM) to
  receive a notification with the day's weather forecast.
***Details:**
* Provide a simple time picker for the user to set their preferred announcement
  time.
* The scheduled announcement should be delivered via a local notification and a
  voice alert.
* The notification should be reliable and trigger even if the app is in the
  background or closed.#### 4.1.3. Weather

* **Requirement:** The app must fetch key weather information to be included in
  the daily announcement.
* **User Story:** As a user, I want my daily notification to tell me the
  current temperature, a brief weather description (e.g., "Sunny," "Cloudy,"
  "Rain", "Snow"), and the high/low temperatures for the day.
* **Details:**
* Integrate with a reliable weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI).
* The weather data should be refreshed daily in conjunction with the scheduled
announcement.
* The announcement will contain:
  * Current temperature.
  * Weather condition icon/description.
  * Daily high and low temperatures.
  * Any severe weather alerts if applicable.
  * The app should handle API errors gracefully, providing a fallback message
    if weather data cannot be retrieved.

#### 4.1.4. User Interface

* **Requirement:** The UI will be used for the initial setup and for any
  subsequent changes to the user's location or the desired announcement time.
* **User Story:** As a user, I want a simple setup screen to enter my location
  and set my notification time. I also want to be able to easily change these
  settings later.
* **Details:**
* A single setup screen will be presented on the first launch.
* This screen will contain input fields for location (if not automatically
  detected) and a time picker for the announcement.
* The app will provide a clear and accessible way for users to re-open the
  settings screen to make changes.
* Other than the settings screen, no other UI will be visible in the app.

### 4.2. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance:** The app should be lightweight and have a minimal impact on
  battery life and device performance.
* **Reliability:** The scheduled notifications must be delivered consistently at
  the user-configured time.
* **Usability:** The app must be extremely easy to use, with a near-zero
  learning curve.
* **Platform Support:** The initial version will be developed for Android, with
  potential for iOS support in the future.

## 5. Assumptions and Dependencies

* **Assumption:** Users will have an active internet connection to fetch weather
  data.
* **Assumption:** Users will grant the necessary location and notification
  permissions for the app to function correctly.
* **Dependency:** The app will rely on a third-party weather API for forecast
data.
* **Dependency:** The app will use device-specific services for location and
notifications.
* **Dependency:** State management will be handled by the GetX package.
* **Dependency:** Local storage for user settings will be managed by the Hive
package.

## 6. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for V1)

* **Customizable Notifications:** Let users choose what information is included
  in the weather announcement.
* **Voice Announcements:** Read the weather forecast aloud.
* **Theming:** Offer different color themes (e.g., light/dark mode).
* **iOS Version:** Develop and release an iOS version of the application.
