/// Main entry point for the announcement scheduler package.
///
/// [AnnouncementScheduler] provides a clean API for scheduling both one-time
/// and recurring text-to-speech announcements using local notifications.
///
/// ## Features
///
/// - Schedule announcements for specific times with [scheduleAnnouncement]
/// - Schedule one-time announcements with [scheduleOneTimeAnnouncement]
/// - Support for recurring patterns: daily, weekdays, weekends, or custom days
/// - Built-in TTS (Text-to-Speech) support with configurable voice settings
/// - Validation to prevent excessive notifications
/// - Timezone-aware scheduling
/// - Status updates via [statusStream]
///
/// ## Usage Example
///
/// ```dart
/// // Initialize the scheduler
/// final scheduler = await AnnouncementScheduler.initialize(
///   config: AnnouncementConfig(
///     notificationConfig: NotificationConfig(
///       channelId: 'my_announcements',
///       channelName: 'My Announcements',
///       channelDescription: 'Scheduled text-to-speech announcements',
///     ),
///   ),
/// );
///
/// // Schedule a daily announcement
/// final id = await scheduler.scheduleAnnouncement(
///   content: 'Good morning! Time for your daily reminder.',
///   announcementTime: TimeOfDay(hour: 8, minute: 0),
///   recurrence: RecurrencePattern.daily,
/// );
///
/// // Schedule a one-time announcement
/// await scheduler.scheduleOneTimeAnnouncement(
///   content: 'Special reminder',
///   dateTime: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 2)),
/// );
///
/// // Clean up when done
/// await scheduler.dispose();
/// ```
///
/// ## Configuration
///
/// Configure TTS settings, notification behavior, and validation rules through
/// [AnnouncementConfig]. See [NotificationConfig] and [ValidationConfig] for
/// detailed configuration options.
///
/// ## Error Handling
///
/// The scheduler throws specific exceptions for different error conditions:
///
/// - [ValidationException]: Invalid input or validation failures
/// - [NotificationPermissionDeniedException]: Permission denied by user
/// - [NotificationInitializationException]: Notification setup failed
/// - [NotificationSchedulingException]: Scheduling operation failed
/// - [TTSInitializationException]: TTS setup failed
///
/// See also:
///
/// - [AnnouncementConfig] for configuration options
/// - [RecurrencePattern] for recurring announcement patterns
/// - [ScheduledAnnouncement] for announcement data model
/// - [AnnouncementStatus] for announcement lifecycle states

  /// Initialize the announcement scheduler with the given configuration.
  ///
  /// This is the primary factory method for creating an [AnnouncementScheduler]
  /// instance. It must be called before any scheduling operations.
  ///
  /// The method performs the following initialization steps:
  ///
  /// 1. Initializes timezone data for accurate scheduling
  /// 2. Sets up the notification system with platform-specific configurations
  /// 3. Initializes TTS (Text-to-Speech) if enabled in the config
  /// 4. Creates notification channels (Android) or requests permissions (iOS)
  ///
  /// ## Parameters
  ///
  /// - [config]: Configuration for the scheduler, including TTS settings,
  ///   notification preferences, and validation rules. See [AnnouncementConfig]
  ///   for all available options.
  ///
  /// ## Returns
  ///
  /// A [Future] that completes with a fully initialized [AnnouncementScheduler]
  /// instance ready to schedule announcements.
  ///
  /// ## Throws
  ///
  /// - [NotificationInitializationException] if notification setup fails
  /// - [TTSInitializationException] if TTS setup fails (when TTS is enabled)
  ///
  /// ## Example
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// final scheduler = await AnnouncementScheduler.initialize(
  ///   config: AnnouncementConfig(
  ///     enableTTS: true,
  ///     ttsRate: 0.5,
  ///     ttsPitch: 1.0,
  ///     forceTimezone: true,

  ///
  /// ## Parameters
  ///
  /// - [content]: The text content to be announced via TTS and shown in the
  ///   notification. Must not be empty.
  ///
  /// - [announcementTime]: The time of day when the announcement should be
  ///   delivered. For recurring announcements, this time will be used for all
  ///   occurrences.
  ///
  /// - [recurrence]: The recurrence pattern for the announcement. Use:
  ///   - [RecurrencePattern.daily] for every day
  ///   - [RecurrencePattern.weekdays] for Monday-Friday
  ///   - [RecurrencePattern.weekends] for Saturday-Sunday
  ///   - [RecurrencePattern.custom] with [customDays] for specific days
  ///   - `null` for a one-time announcement
  ///
  /// - [customDays]: Required when [recurrence] is [RecurrencePattern.custom].
  ///   List of day numbers where 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, ..., 7=Sunday.
  ///   Ignored for other recurrence patterns.
  ///
  /// - [metadata]: Optional custom data to associate with the announcement.
  ///   This can be used to store additional context or application-specific
  ///   information.
  ///
  /// ## Returns
  ///
  /// A [Future] that completes with a unique announcement ID that can be used
  /// to cancel the announcement later via [cancelAnnouncementById].
  ///
  /// ## Throws
  ///
  /// - [ValidationException] if:
  ///   - [content] is empty
  ///   - [recurrence] is custom but [customDays] is null or empty
  ///   - [customDays] contains invalid day numbers (not 1-7)
  ///   - Scheduling would exceed configured limits

  ///     case AnnouncementStatus.scheduled:
  ///       print('Announcement scheduled successfully');
